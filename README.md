## SpaceTimeUpscaling
### Data repository accompanying the paper "Space-time upscaling of reactive transport in porous media" by Nicolae Suciu, Florin A. Radu, and Iuliu S. Pop

This is a data repository accompanying the paper "Space-time upscaling of reactive transport in porous media" by Nicolae Suciu, Florin A. Radu, and Iuliu S. Pop (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2023.104443).
#
The repository contains coarse grained space-time (CGST) averaging procedures embeded in Matlab codes based on Global Random Walk (GRW) 
algorithms to solve problems for reactive transport in natural porous media. The CGST averages perform a space-time upscaling of the fine 
grained concentrations of the reacting chemical species to the spatio-temoral scale of a hypothetic measurement.
#
The codes for verification tests of the CGST-GRW method and applications to one- and two-dimensional biodegradation processes in saturated aquifers and variably saturated soils are included in the following folders:

#### 1D/

- Bimolecular_reactions

- CGST_Aquifers

- CGST_Soils

#### 2D/
