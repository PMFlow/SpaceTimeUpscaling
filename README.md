# SpaceTimeUpscaling
## Data repository accompanying the paper "Space-time upscaling of reactive transport in porous media" by Nicolae Suciu and Florin A. Radu


The repository contains coarse grained space-time (CGST) averaging procedures embeded Matlab codes based on Global Random Walk (GRW) 
algorithms to solve problems for reactive transport in natural porous media. The CGST averages perform an space-time upscaling of the fine 
grained concentrations of the reacting chemical species to the spatio-temoral scale of a hypothetic measurement.

The codes for verification tests and applications to one-dimensional biodegradation processes in saturated aquifers and variably saturated 
soils are included in the following folders:

#
### Verification
#
### Bimolecular_reactions
#
### CGST_Aquifers
#
### CGST_Soils
