This folder contains the following Matlab scrips:

#
- 'main_1D_Reaction.m' is the main program to compute CGST of bimolecular reactions with mass 
	conservation and estimations of the intrinsic diffusion coefficients D and the flow velocity u.

- 'CG_BGRW_1D.m' is the function for the unbiased algorithm BGRW for CGST simulations (with details 
	for the computation of D and u).

- 'CG_reaction' is the function for nolinear bimolecular reactions.

- 'plot_CG.m' is a function used to plot CGST averages.
